Project Summary:
	   In this project I have developed a mobile application using which a farmer can monitor the temperature, humidity, pressure and soil moisture parameters along with weather forecasting details. Based on these details he can water the crops by controlling the motors through the app and the app gives an alert message if temperature or humidty goes beyond a threshold value.
