"# llSPS-INT-1405-Smart-Agriculture-system-based-on-IoT" 
  
Project Summary:
	  Agriculture plays a crucial role in the life of an economy. It is the backbone of our economic system, so improving the quality and way of production is crucial.Here comes the Smart Agriculture system.
Smart agriculture helps in automated farming, collection of data from the field and then analyses it so that the farmer can make accurate decision in order to grow high quality crop.
IoT based Smart Farming also improves the entire Agriculture system by monitoring the field in real-time. With the help of sensors and interconnectivity, the Internet of Things in Agriculture has not only saved the time of the farmers but has also reduced the extravagant use of resources such as Water and Electricity.
So in this project I have developed a mobile application using which a farmer can monitor the temperature,humidity and soil moisture,pressure parameters along with weather forecasting details. Based on this details he can water the crops by controlling the motors through the app.
